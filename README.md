# üêà Purrfect Cats

Purrfect Cats is a Python-based application that simulates the management of both domestic and wild cats. Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, this project models various cat behaviors such as eating, playing, hunting, and sleeping. 

This project also serves as an opportunity to improve my skills with GitHub, applying best practices for version control, collaboration, and branching. It leverages GitHub‚Äôs tools, such as Pull Requests (PRs) for code review, and integrates clear documentation with docstrings and automated tests to ensure maintainability and code quality. Additionally, I am using this project to prepare for the GitHub Foundations certification exam, further solidifying my knowledge of GitHub‚Äôs core features and workflows.

## Features

- **Cat class**: The base class that defines the common behaviors for all cats, including meowing, eating, playing, and sleeping.
- **DomesticCat subclass**: Inherits from `Cat` and adds a unique method for asking for affection.
- **WildCat subclass**: Inherits from `Cat`, modifies the `meow()` method to an aggressive roar, and includes a method for hunting to reduce energy but recover hunger.
- **Interactive menu**: A small menu allowing users to interact with cats by adding them, listing them, and performing various actions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13.0

## Acknowledgments

- This project was created as a learning exercise to practice Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python, and to apply best practices of version control and collaborative workflows using GitHub.
