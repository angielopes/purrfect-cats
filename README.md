# Purrfect Cats

CatManager is a Python-based application that simulates the management of both domestic and wild cats. Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, this project models various cat behaviors such as eating, playing, meowing, and sleeping. 

## Features

- **Cat class**: The base class that defines the common behaviors for all cats, including meowing, eating, playing, and sleeping.
- **DomesticCat subclass**: Inherits from `Cat` and adds a unique method for asking for affection.
- **WildCat subclass**: Inherits from `Cat`, modifies the `meow()` method to an aggressive roar, and includes a method for hunting to reduce energy but recover hunger.
- **Interactive menu**: A small menu allowing users to interact with cats by adding them, listing them, and performing various actions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13.0

## Acknowledgments

- This project was created as a learning exercise to practice Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python.
